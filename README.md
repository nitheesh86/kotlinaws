# kotlinaws
This project is code for the RelaDev Blog Series - [My Kotlin AWS Journey](https://reladev.org/my-kotlin-aws-journey/).

The organization of this code is a little different then normal.  Since the blog series that builds on previous code, each blog gets its own branch.  This was done, so that changes and fixes in earlier blog code can easily be merged into all blogs.  Each branch starts with "/blog/", then a number and the name of the blog.  The number is used to order the code to allow for easier merging.
